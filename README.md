# Amplicon-Analysis
An amplicon analysis in R.

- This is a file created in R markdown to showcase my practice amplicon analysis.
- My goal was to become more familiar with bioinformatics workflows and programming in R.
- The analysis and code closely follows the tutorial from here: https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/dada2_workflow_ex#extracting-the-standard-goods-from-dada2
